        <h3> Early Life</h3>
        <p>Mitnick was born in Van Nuys, California, into a Jewish family.He grew up in Los Angeles and attended James Monroe High School in Sepulveda, California,during which time he became an amateur radio operator.He was later enrolled at Los Angeles Pierce College and USC.

      <div id="computer-hacking">
        <h3>Computer Hacking</h3>
        <p>At age 12, Mitnick used social engineering and dumpster divingto bypass the punch card system used in the Los Angeles bus system. After he convinced a bus driver to tell him where he could buy his own ticket punch for "a school project", he was able to ride any bus in the greater LA area using unused transfer slips he found in a dumpster next to the bus company garage. Social engineering later became his primary method of obtaining information, including usernames and passwords and modem phone numbers.</p>
        <p>
          Mitnick first gained unauthorized access to a computer network in 1979, at 16, when a friend gave him the phone number for the Ark, the computer system Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) used for developing their RSTS/E operating system software.
